# Project Unit 1

## Criterion A: Planning
### Problem definition: 
My client is a Vacation Home Management Company, residing in Karuizawa, a tourist-heavy town in the middle of Japan. This company is responsible for managing multiple vacation homes and handling sensitive client information such as necessities' payment details, access codes to properties, and even private itineraries. Since many high-profile clients stay at these properties, the company needs to maintain top-notch security for both physical and digital access. The employees, including property managers, maintenance staff, and temporary workers, often have to access confidential information like passwords for security systems, Wi-Fi networks, and private customer accounts. However, this sensitive information needs to be handled discreetly, especially when employees are mobile and might work from public spaces, like caf√©s or shared offices, or while physically on-site at properties.
### Proposed solution: 
Hence, I come in to provide the company with a custom-built tool disguised as a simple to-do-list app. The app serves dual purposes: as an application for tracking tasks, and, when the hidden code is entered, it transforms into a basic password manager. This allows authorized employees to securely access passwords without drawing attention or compromising security.
