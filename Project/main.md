# Project Unit 1

## Criterion A: Planning
### Problem definition: 
My client is a Vacation Home Management Company, residing in Karuizawa, a tourist-heavy town in the middle of Japan. This company is responsible for overseeing and maintaining the state of multiple vacation homes in the area. The majority of their customers, or the vacation home owners, belong to the upper-middle class or high-working class. Therefore, they tend to have high expectations of how the little chores and specific things around the house should be taken care of and there is usually a fixed group of people managing a certain set of houses, such as property managers, maintenance staff, and temporary workers. These employees often have to access confidential information like passwords for security systems, Wi-Fi networks, private customer accounts, and even private itineraries. Thus, this sensitive information needs to be handled discreetly, and as the company's scale expands to more houses over holiday seasons, the databases also get expanded. As all the company's employees were accessing on the same database, exposing the data for unauthorized staff, they have a needs to create an updated management program for their database.

### Proposed solution: 
Hence, I come in to provide the company with a custom-built tool disguised as a simple to-do-list app. The program serves dual purposes: as an application for tracking tasks, and, when the hidden code is entered, it transforms into a basic password manager. This allows authorized employees to securely access passwords without drawing attention or compromising security.
